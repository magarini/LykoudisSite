            <p>
                Pantelis Lykoudis was introduced to music through the Orff approach, while at 7 he picked up saxophone.
                After receiving his diploma in Greece, he pursued further studies at HKU Utrechts Conservatorium with
                Johan van der Linden. Currently, he pursues a master's degree in the class of Jonathan Hulting-Cohen at
                UMass Amherst, where he also holds a teaching assistantship. He has participated in masterclasses of
                Marcus Weiss and Frederick Hemke, among others.
            </p>
            <p>Pantelis has performed and recorded with many ensembles, including Anemone Saxophone Quartet (the
                Netherlands, Austria), Katahdin Duo (the Netherlands), the European Union Youth Wind Orchestra (Germany,
                France, Luxembourg) and Vienna Saxophone Ensemble (Italy), as well as being active in the free
                improvisation scene (Greece, the Netherlands). A strong advocate of new music, he has premiered numerous
                works through fruitful collaborations with composers from around the world.
