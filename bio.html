                Pantelis Lykoudis was born in Athens, Greece in 1992. At age 5 he was introduced to music through the Orff approach, while at 7 he picked up saxophone. He received his saxophone diploma in 2016 from Dionisios Roussos' class at Orfeio Conservatory. The following year he pursued further studies at HKU Utrechts Conservatorium with Johan van der Linden, graduating in 2021. Additionally, in 2020 he studied for one semester with Gerald Preinfalk at KunstUni Graz, through the Erasmus exchange program. Currently, he pursues a master's degree in the class of Jonathan Hulting-Cohen at UMass Amherst, where he also holds a teaching assistantship. In 2018 he participated at the Frederick Hemke Saxophone Institute in Maine, while in 2021 he joined Marcus Weiss' saxophone studio and other workshops at the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse. In addition, he has participated in masterclasses of Alain Crepin, Ryo Noda, Apollo Saxophone Quartet and Carl-Emmanuel Fisbach, among others.

Pantelis has performed and recorded with many ensembles, including Anemone Saxophone Quartet (the Netherlands, Austria), Katahdin Duo (the Netherlands), the European Union Youth Wind Orchestra (Germany, France, Luxembourg) and Vienna Saxophone Ensemble (Italy), as well as being active in the free improvisation scene (Greece, the Netherlands). He has premiered numerous works through fruitful collaborations with European and American composers, while he presented a workshop at the Xenakis 22 International Symposium.
